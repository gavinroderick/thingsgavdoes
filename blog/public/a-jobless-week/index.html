      <h1 id="im-starting-a-new-job">I&#39;m starting a new job!</h1>
      <p>
        I&#39;ve left my job at IGS. This was my first job in software after
        leaving university, so it&#39;s a bit bittersweet, but it&#39;s time for
        me to move on. Leaving behind the friends that I&#39;ve made and grown
        with over a couple of very difficult years has been tough, but with the
        support they&#39;ve given me, I know it&#39;s the right choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next week, I&#39;ll start my new job at Clevermed, which I&#39;m super
        excited about. It&#39;s a smaller company than IGS, but they&#39;re
        still people focussed. From conversations and impressions in interviews,
        I&#39;m going to love working here, and I&#39;m super excited to start!
      </p>
      <p>
        But before that, I&#39;ve got a week of downtime to fill. It&#39;s
        something I&#39;ve really been looking forward to, just a week to get a
        bunch of odd stuff done, tasks, goals and trips of all kinds.
      </p>
      <p>
        So here&#39;s a shortlist of things that I&#39;m hoping to get done, I
        don&#39;t expect to get through it all, and I&#39;m sure that I&#39;ll
        add some ad-hoc stuff to it over the week, but for now, here&#39;s the
        plan.
      </p>
      <h3 id="gavs-todo-list">Gav&#39;s ToDo list</h3>

        On the face of it, there&#39;s quite a lot here. But I&#39;m confident I
        can check off a bunch of these and get a lot done in this week! All
        going to plan, we&#39;ll be able to check back in here in a week and
        I&#39;ll tell you all about how it went!
