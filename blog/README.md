## thingsgavdoes blog [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/a5096478-af15-4d1e-a3ac-f0d7a7fc8d4d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/thingsgavdoes-blog/deploys)

### The what

A nice simple blog. Specifically, a static site, using HTML generated from markdown files

### The how

Built using vanillaJS, HTML and poor CSS skills.

Initially following a great tutorial that @kartiknair [posted here](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-build-a-simple-static-site-generator-using-node-js-6425b71272e0).

### The why

Mostly a project to try and improve my writing. Will probably end up being a first place to tinker with new things.

#### ToDo

- [ X ] Create first draft of blog
- [ ] Add some styling so it doesn't look awful
- [ ] TypeScript?! O_o
- [ ] Follow up post on how much I got done in my week off
- [ ] SEO nonsense for no good reason
- [ ] "Contact me" form with netlify function? For the ha ha's
