Today, I set out with a clear goal in mind: cycle across town, find a nice coffee shop, sit down, and work on a side project with my partner. Things started off well enough - I got on my bike and headed up Leith Walk, enjoying the ride despite the rain. However, my luck ran out when I hit the patchwork quilt of road near Waverly. I went over a pothole, my tire went flat, and I was feeling pretty frustrated.

But, "no matter", I said! I'm a resourceful individual; I have a phone in my pocket. I'll simply locate my nearest bike shop, and get back on the road! 

Well, that's where hurdle number 2 came up. Only one bike store near me, and it's up over North bridge. No fear, I've got fight in my legs, let's push the bike there! Did I mention that when it rains in edinburgh all of the paving slabs turn strangely slimy and slippy? No? Well now you know. 

Perfect conditions to push a bike uphill. 

Anyway, I found the bike shop, lo and behold it's shut! Probably makes sense as it's bank holiday weekend. I don't observe them, but fair enough to those who do take a break, just poor timing for me.

Here begins the big adult sulking I did.

Honestly, I was pretty miserable. I was stood in the rain outside a closed bike shop, annoyed and wanting to be anywhere else. I was muttering to myself, angry that I hadn't brought a spare inner tube with me, and generally being a brat.

But I didn't want to be. This is my day off, and I don't want to spend it being angry. So I put into place something I've been trying to practise when things go wrong. Introducing...

## The Anti-Sulk Strategy™️

1. Take a minute & embrace the sulking
    Make a few petulant remarks. Stomp around a bit. Vent, cry if you have to! Just allow yourself to feel whatever emotions you want for a few minutes. 
2. Step away from the situation
    Figure out a way to step away from the situation that's making you unhappy. If you're on a bike, find somewhere to chain it up.
3. Find somewhere to get something to eat and a little drink
    This is the gamechanger. Find somewhere, be it a cafe, bar, food stand or shop, and get yourself a little treat. Doesn't have to be anything major, my go-to is a coffee and a cake. Sit in, if you can. Relax. Enjoy the food. If you need to vent about the situation, vent about it a bit! If you're on your own, write a poorly written blog post about it! (aka this one!)
4. Think about solutions
    Now that you're hopefully a bit less stressed, and out of the situation, think about things that you can do to remedy the situation. In most cases, you're gonna be able to come up with something, now that you're not in the thick of it. 
5. Carry on with your day!
    Hopefully, you'll be refreshed and renewed after your break! Be proud that you managed to figure something out, and didn't collapse in a puddle of rage/anxiety/sadness. And if this hasn't helped, that's ok too! Sometimes, life just throws the bucket at you, and it sucks. If nothing else, at least you'll have more energy to go deal with a bad situation now.

I didn't get my cycle across town today. I haven't even looked at the code I wanted to. And that's ok. I just dipped into a coffee shop and started writing this post. It might not have been the way I envisaged my day starting, but I have enjoyed it. 

Sometimes I let small situations build up in my head to be something far worse than they are in reality. I'm trying to get better at not doing that. This strategy definitely helps me out, so I'm hoping it might do the same for someone else.
