# I'm starting a new job!

I've left my job at IGS. This was my first job in software after leaving university, so it's a bit bittersweet, but it's time for me to move on. Leaving behind the friends that I've made and grown with over a couple of very difficult years has been tough, but with the support they've given me, I know it's the right choice.

Next week, I'll start my new job at Clevermed, which I'm super excited about. It's a smaller company than IGS, but they're still people focussed. From conversations and impressions in interviews, I'm going to love working here, and I'm super excited to start!

But before that, I've got a week of downtime to fill. It's something I've really been looking forward to, just a week to get a bunch of odd stuff done, tasks, goals and trips of all kinds.

So here's a shortlist of things that I'm hoping to get done, I don't expect to get through it all, and I'm sure that I'll add some ad-hoc stuff to it over the week, but for now, here's the plan.

### Gav's ToDo list

- [ ] Finally create a blog and start writing (just get something on the web, it doesn't have to be perfect)
- [ ] Explore using NX to host personal projects
- [ ] Put up those picture in the office
- [ ] Camping trip with Val <3
  - [ ] Paddleboarding in Loch Lomond
  - [ ] Sit in the hammock and read
  - [ ] Go for a walk along the WHW to the Falls of Falloch
  - [ ] Wild swimming!
  - [ ] Campfire cooking and relaxing with music
- [ ] Help sister clear her house
- [ ] Support Kit, Marcus and Tim at the Edinburgh Half Marathon!
- [ ] Go for a **big** cycle

On the face of it, there's quite a lot here. But I'm confident I can check off a bunch of these and get a lot done in this week! All going to plan, we'll be able to check back in here in a week and I'll tell you all about how it went!
