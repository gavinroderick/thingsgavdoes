# Creating a static site generator

A test blog post to show how I built this blog

- Followed the tutorial by Kartik Nair [at this page](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-build-a-simple-static-site-generator-using-node-js-6425b71272e0)
- That's it really, that's pretty much it
- Hopefully deployed it with NX and Netlify in a blog post that you can find in a [few weeks here](https://blog.thingsgavdoes.com/deploying-a-blog-with-nx-and-netlify)
