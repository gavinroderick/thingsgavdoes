# todays thing 1

### ðŸ’« todays thing ðŸ’«

###### a place for me to tell somebody something uninteresting

I got my bike wheel jammed in a tram track on princes street and got thrown off my bike! It sucked, a lot, but we move ðŸ’ƒ

seriously though, I was a bit shaken up by it. there was one bus behind me and one in the lane to my left so I was pretty scared. The driver was paying attention and stopped pretty quickly, then got out to check that I was ok ðŸ’“

I'm fine now, got a taxi back home with the bike, just some cuts on my legs - could've been much worse.

Stay safe out on them tracks folks.
