So. Mere minutes after uploading my last (first) blog post, I had a pretty sucky realisation.

> "I've got no idea what to write about." - me

Anyway, I figured since it's my website, I can post whatever I want. And sometimes, I'd like to be able to just dump out some thoughts about some stuff that's happened to me today.

"But Gavin, why don't you just tweet it? ðŸ¤”"

"that's dumb, nobody wants to hear what you have to say ðŸ’…"

Well to those two strawmen, I say shut up, I hate tweeting and I don't actually want people to read about my day, I just need a place to vent.

All of this is just a long way to introduce:

### ðŸ’« todays thing ðŸ’«

###### a place for me to tell somebody something uninteresting

Which for now is literally just a short post that starts with that title. At some point I'd like to make it a seperate part of the site, but baby steps etc...

Anyway, yeah so [here's the link](/todays-thing-1) byeeeeeeeeee

Gav

p.s. I uploaded this, and the thing at the same time, and have no idea if that link is gonna go to the right place or not, so I assume my one reader will let me know swiftly if doesn't
