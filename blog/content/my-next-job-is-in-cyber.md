i'm upskilling myself. taking the governments advice, and reskilling in "cyber" ðŸ™„

While I was applying for jobs, I found myself being disapointed that a lot of jobs required experience with [React.](https://reactjs.org) Not that I'm *unwilling* to learn, mind you, I've just never used it before. I definitely didn't feel confident applying to roles where I might spend half of my time using it.

So that's the way it was, I saw great jobs, and didn't bother to put in applications, because I didn't want to get rejected. 

Then I realised, there was literally nothing stopping me from going and teaching myself it. Not one thing. 

So I did it. I googled React tutorial, and followed it. Made myself a nice [noughts and crosses game](https://github.com/gavinroderick/react-playgrounds/tree/main/my-app). That was easy. Kinda made it seem like a lot bigger deal in my head. 

Now to come up with a project of my own....

### Introducing: [house-dashboard!](https://github.com/gavinroderick/house-dashboard)

It's our soon to be one stop shop for all the info we might need when we're leaving the house. 

So far, it's a single component, which shows the weather for my house ![Weather widget for house-dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19315682/177154471-20ee57d3-74d7-4446-91a8-e6e5c871f3eb.png)

It ain't much, but it'll do the job. And it'll serve as a good training project to let me learn react in a bit more depth. 


As a complete aside, I managed to talk about it in a job interview as well, they asked about personal development and learning, and I was able to point them to this project as an example. Yay!


Anyway, this is probably my longest blog post to date, so I'll leave it here for now.

I'm hoping to do a bit of an explaination of how I built each widget as I go along, so who knows, I might get to that soon.
